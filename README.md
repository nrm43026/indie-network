# indie-network
One of my first websites, it was the final project in my intro to web development class.  Overall, I think it was a good first attempt even though there's some compatability issues.
Some features include an image gallery in the header that cycles through animated gifs, interactive previews that play on hover, buttons that link to each game's steam store page, and a very basic log in system (use "P@ssword1").
